      <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Founded in 2019 during the times of covid 19 and i was inspired by my big big brother who owned a bakery and i used to help him. After sometime i gained passion in baking and decided to learn more, Shalom Cakes began as a small bakery in the heart of Kampala, Uganda. Inspired by a love for baking and a commitment to excellence, our founder, Nakayongo Hanifah, turned her passion for creating delectable desserts into a thriving business. Over the years, we’ve grown into a beloved name, known for our artisanal cakes that blend tradition with innovation. Every cake we bake tells a story of dedication, creativity, and the joy of bringing people together.
